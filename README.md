# About Me

I am **Muhammet Öztürk**, a software engineer and artificial intelligence developer focused on building practical, production-ready systems. My work spans computer vision, machine learning, real-time media pipelines, embedded hardware, and developer tooling.

## What I Do
I design and implement AI systems end to end:
- Data capture and preprocessing  
- Model integration and optimization  
- Real-time inference pipelines  
- UI and interaction layers (Python + JS)  
- Deployment on cloud, local Linux systems or embedded devices  

I work extensively with Python (PyTorch, TensorFlow), JavaScript, Jupyter/Colab, Debian, Raspberry Pi, and hardware-accelerated inference on microcontrollers and Jetson-class devices.

## Skills

### Core Engineering
- Python, JavaScript, TypeScript  
- PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV  
- Data processing pipelines  
- Reusable module & package design  
- End-to-end system architecture  

### AI & Machine Learning
- Computer vision  
- Multimodal models  
- Model optimization & quantization  
- Real-time inference pipelines  
- Edge deployment (Jetson, Raspberry Pi, microcontrollers)

### Tools & Platforms
- Linux (Debian-based systems)  
- Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab  
- Docker & container-based workflows  
- FastAPI, WebSocket-based communication  
- Hardware integration (camera/mic, sensors)  

### Teaching & Content Creation
- Clear technical writing  
- Step-by-step AI guides  
- Hands-on education for beginners and intermediate learners  
- Development of practical examples, demos, and tooling  

## Engineering Approach
My engineering style prioritizes:
- Clear abstractions  
- Maintainable structure  
- Fast iteration  
- Reusable modules  
- Verified, measurable results  

I build tools, libraries, and educational material that make AI systems easier to understand and deploy. I also mentor young developers and help them build a solid foundation in modern machine learning.

## Blog
I write technical articles, tutorials, and deep-dives on my blog:  
**https://muhammetozturk.github.io**

The blog includes content on Python, SQL, machine learning, computer vision, OOP, hardware-AI integration, and practical engineering patterns.

## Current Focus
- Real-time multimodal AI (vision + audio)  
- Model optimization and deployment on edge devices  
- Developer tools for Colab, Jupyter, and web-based AI interactions  
- Educational content for the next generation of engineers  

My goal is to bridge research and production: prototype fast, build reliably, deploy effectively, and teach clearly.
